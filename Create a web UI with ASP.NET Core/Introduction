In this module, you'll create a cross-platform ASP.NET Core Razor Pages web app with .NET and C#.

Example Scenario

Suppose you're an employee of a pizza company named Contoso Pizza. Your manager has asked you to develop a pizza inventory management page as a prerequisite for the company's internal admin website. The app should be built in such a way that the view and data model concerns are separated.

What will you be doing?
In this module, you will:

    x   Understand when and why to use Razor Pages for your ASP.NET Core app.
    x   Review an existing ASP.NET Core app that uses Razor Pages.
    x   Create a new Razor Page that supports the app's product data management requirements.
    x   Use tag helpers to reduce the context switching between HTML and C#.
    x   Use Razor Page handlers to handle HTTP requests.
    x   At the end of this module, there are links to content providing deeper dives for each
        feature area introduced.

Required tools

This module uses the .NET CLI (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/) and Visual Studio Code (Windows, Linux, and macOS) to demonstrate ASP.NET Core Razor Pages development. After completing this module, you can apply its concepts using a development environment like Visual Studio (Windows), Visual Studio for Mac (macOS), or Visual Studio Code.
